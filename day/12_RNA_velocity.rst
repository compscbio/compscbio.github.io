RNA Velocity
------------------------

- Guest Lecture by Kathleen Noller
- Review of trajectory inference (TI)
- What is RNA Velocity (RV)?
- RV vs TI
- Splicing and transcription
- Measuring spliced vs unspliced transcripts
- RV model & assumptions
 + ds/du = u - gamma * s
 + u = unspliced mRNA
 + s = spliced RNA
 + gamma = degradation rate
 + assumes constant splicing rate

- Phase portrait
- Example: bulk RNAseq and cell cycle
- Example: scRNAseq Schwann progenitors
- Example: scRNAseq mouse hippocampus
- Splicing and degradation rates
- scVelo
