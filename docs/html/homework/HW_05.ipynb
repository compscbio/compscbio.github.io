    "That same sadistic post-doc in your lab has just read the RNA Velocity paper and is _even more_ excited about it than about Cytotrace. You decide to see how well Velocity pseudotime compares to Cytotrace score derived pseudotime using data for which you can reasonably anchor the starting point of the trajectory inference."

    "Run your usual pre-processing, clustering and annotation. Perform Cytotrace analysis. Then run RNA velocity and plot the velocity embeddings on either (1) the 1st and 3rd principal components, or (2) the UMAP embedding (which you need to figure out how to make from the scanpy documentation). Then compute velocity pseudotime. Finally, as you did in HW4, compute diffusion based pseudotime. \n",
