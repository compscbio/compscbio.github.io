Cell identity
------------------------

- iPSC life cycle as motivating example
- Cell fate engineering
- CFE fidelity
- What is a cell type? Survey says...
- Turing test
- Functional tests

  + engraftment of HSCs
  + chimeras

- Drawbacks of functional tests
- Circuitry test
- Transcriptional state as intermediate phenotype
- Clustering
- Hierarchical
- Linkage
- Distance
- Application of clustering to iPSCs
- Decision trees
- Random forest (RF)
- RF for scRNAseq cell typing
