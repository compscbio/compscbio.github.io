Computational Stem Cell Biology EN580.447/647
=============================================

This course provides a mechanistic and systems biology-based understanding of two defining features of stem cells: multipotency and self-renewal. We explore these concepts across several contexts and perspectives, emphasizing seminal and new studies in development and stem cell biology, and the critical role that computational approaches have played. The course will start with an introduction to stem cells and a tutorial covering computational basics. The biological contexts that we will cover thereafter include "Cell Identity", "Pluripotency and multipotency", "Stem cells and their niche", "Modeling cell fate decisions", and "Engineering cell fate".

This class is heavily weighted by individual computational assignments. The motivation for this strategy is that regularly occurring, moderately-sized computational projects are the most efficient way to impart an understanding of our models of this extraordinary class of cells, and to inspire a sense of excitement and empowerment. Preferred background: familiarity with R and the UNIX shell.
