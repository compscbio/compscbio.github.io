    "Estimating maturity is useful as a metric, but it does not provide an immediate path forward in the form of specific hypotheses for how to improve the engineered CMs. Your collaborators want to identify candidate TFs that they could overexpress or knock out to further enhance differentiation. Set up an in silico screen with CellOracle. The essential components are:\n",
    "1. A training dataset. To ensure relevant cell types are represented, we recommend the in vivo perinatal CM development timecourse from Kannan et al., available in file folder [perinatal_reference_data](https://compstemcellbio.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/final_project/perinatal_reference_data.zip). \n",

    "2. An evaluation dataset. How well do CellOracle’s predicted fold changes correspond to what would actually happen? You can test this using a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of the transcription factor Prdm16, which was assayed with scRNA-seq at embryonic day 13.5 in figure 6 of [Wu et al. 2022.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915728/). These data have been downsampled to 5,000 barcodes and are available in the [wu_prdm16 folder](https://compstemcellbio.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/final_project/wu_prdm16.zip).

To obtain better performance across a wider range of testable perturbations, compare three options for the base network: completely dense (all possible connections), CellOracle’s default, and a custom base network derived from motif analysis of the ATAC-seq data in Figure 3 of Stone et al, available in <b>direct_conversion_data/GSE130806_Bulk_Atac_Count_Data.bed</b>. As controls, also include randomly generated networks matching the density of the motif-derived networks.

    "Aside from overexpressing transcription factors, another method of optimizing cell fate engineering is to use drug compounds or morphogens that target signaling pathways with important roles in embryonic development. (Box 1 gives some context on morphogens.) Modify or repurpose CellOracle to allow predictions of transcriptomic changes due to activation or repression of signaling pathways. Ideally, any new method of this sort would be tested on a prediction task relevant to in vitro directed differentiation. One potential test dataset is [this screen of 320 FDA-approved drugs for maturation of mouse colon organoids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124721003405), available in the [compound_screening folder](https://compstemcellbio.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/final_project/compound_screen.zip). In each sample, the full transcriptome is not measured, but roughly 200 genes are measured, which provides enough information to test detailed predictions from an extension of CellOracle. If your solution would benefit from a full-transcriptome intestinal organoid dataset, we suggest the mouse intestinal organoid scRNA-seq dataset from [Grün et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14966), which uses the same protocol to culture organoids. This dataset is available in the [grun_organoids folder](https://compstemcellbio.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/final_project/grun_organoids.zip).\n"

    "<b>Box 1: Morphogens.</b> Morphogens are diffusible signals that play a role in patterning of tissues and organs during development. One example of a morphogen is Sonic HedgeHog (SHH). It is a soluble protein. It is important in dorsoventral patterning of vertebrate embryos. During formation of the spinal cord, a flat layer of ectoderm folds inward to form a tube. SHH is secreted from a plate of cells on the innermost side of the tube. It diffuses towards the outermost side. As it reaches the cells that will respond to it, it interacts with membrane-bound protein complexes. Through a moderately complicated series of events, it eventually activates transcription factors from the Gli family. Depending on the dose, different target genes are activated. These target genes repress each others’ expression, giving rise to sharp boundaries between discrete zones with distinct transcriptional profiles. These boundaries remain stable when SHH is removed; the cells are committed to their respective fates. Morphogens provide similar spatial cues throughout development of diverse body structures in diverse organisms. "

    "<b>Morphogen diversity.</b> Morphogens can be soluble proteins like SHH. They can also be small molecules. An example of a natural small-molecule morphogen is retinoic acid, and an example of a natural small-molecule inhibitor of SHH is cyclopamine. (Cyclopamine occurs in plants as a poison, helping defend against herbivorous animals.) Morphogens are often discussed in terms of “pathways”, which describe how the signal reaches the nucleus starting from outside the cell. Other examples of morphogen pathways are Notch, Wnt, bone morphogenic protein (BMP), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Each of these has distinct roles, mechanisms, and quirks. There is a surprisingly small collection of pathways that are re-used in many contexts during development of animals with bilateral symmetry. These receive special attention in stem cell biology. But, it is also possible to screen drugs or compounds with no known role in development; they may still prove useful in directed differentiation protocols."
